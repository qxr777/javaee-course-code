= Example Grafana Dashboard

This folder contains a sample Grafana dashboard that I created for the Board Game
Buddy example in my book. I've not tried it against the example in this repo,
but since it's based on the same metrics exposed by Spring AI, it very well may
work fine.

To use this dashboard, open Grafana, go to "Dashboards", then click the "New"
dropdown in the upper right corner and select "Import". Then either upload the
JSON or paste it into the text field.
